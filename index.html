     <br />What is the work environment like?<br />
    <br />A sports writer usually has an office or a desk, either at their company directly or at a home office. They may expect to write many of their stories from there, but then may expect to travel a great deal. Sports writers often travel with the teams that they cover, and therefore may expect to be on the road quite a bit. This may be a stressful job, particularly when working up against a tight deadline. Though this does allow an individual to write on a subject that they love, the stress and the travel may be challenging at times. They may find the relationships a lot of hard work too in dealing with sports figures.
